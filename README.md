# An_Array_of_Objects
Introducing _Array_Of_Object
•	Create a main class called MainTest (console application)
•	Now using the classes specified above create an array/arraylist to hold the two actors and their details below:

*	Jack Nicholson who’s 74 and lives in Miami, “Wolf”, “As good as it gets”, “ One flew over the Cuckoo’s Nest”; 
*	Violante Placido 38 and lives in Bologna "The american", "Ghost Rider spirit of vengence" " Barah Aanan"

Using the Actor array/Arraylist print the actor’s details on the first line followed by the details of his/her films on the following lines. 

Note :- each Actor has to have his/her own collection of Films – this is known as a deep copy.  If the actor shares his copy of films with another actor it is a shallow copy.

Note :-  the main method is only to use one film array so reuse this array for all actors, the actor owns his/her own films.
From an object perspective there are actor objects who each have a number of film object associated with them, these are stored in an array of films which is an attribute of the actor class.
Add new sections to the program (if necessary) so that there can be many actors and each actor can have many films.  Comment out any previous sections when testing.
